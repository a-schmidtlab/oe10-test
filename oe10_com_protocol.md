# 1. SUMMARY

This document lists the commands that have been implemented in the OE10-104 Serial Pan and Tilt
Unit. For a more complete list of the standard Imenco commands, port settings and timings please
refer to document 0350-5020.

# 3. PACKET DATA STRUCTURE

The packet data structure is a combination of bytes ranging from 0x00 to 0x7F except for the
data section which may contain bytes outside of this range, and will adopt the following
structure:

**<to:from:length:command:data_1 data2 data_3 ... data_n:checksum:checksum ind>**

Where:

To = 1 Byte in the range 0x01 to 0xFF. (0x00 is a reserved address and cannot be used)
The id of the device the packet is intended for. This may be a peripheral device or a controller.
The controllers ID is reserved as 0x01.

From = 1 Byte in the range 0x01 to 0xFF
The id of the device that has transmitted the packet. This may be a peripheral device or a
controller. The controllers ID is reserved as 0x01.

Length = 1 Byte in the range 0x00 to 0xFF.
The combined length of the command section, plus the data section, plus the colon joining them,
e.g. **<to:from:06:TP:034:checksum:checksum ind>.**
If the length of the command section is greater than 99 bytes then the Length will be set to 99
and the user must assume that the data is correct. Command = variable length with a maximum
length of 2 Bytes in the range 0x00 to 0x7F. The command that is to be sent to the peripheral or
controller.

Data = Variable length
The data that is either sent with the command or data that is returned as part of a status check
etc. Data elements are separated with space (0x20) delimiters.

Checksum = 1 Byte
The packet checksum is an XOR of all the bytes (including delimiters such as ‘:’ but excluding
the < at the beginning and the :checksum:checksum ind> section at the end.) in the packet.
If the checksum when calculated, equals 0x3C then the Checksum byte will be set to 0xFF. If the
checksum when calculated, equals 0x3E then the Checksum byte will be set to 0xFF.

Checksum Ind = 1 Byte
If the checksum when calculated, equals 0x3C then the Checksum Ind byte will be set to ASCII

0. If the checksum when calculated, equals 0x3E then the Checksum Ind byte will be set to ASCII
1. For all other values of Calculated checksum the Checksum Ind byte will be set to ASCII G.

## Example:

## For a standard broadcast status packet <to:from:length:command:checksum:checksum ind>

## When converted to hexadecimal the following can be sent:

3C FF 3A 01 3A 03 3A 53 54 3A 3A FA 3A 47 3E

# 4. FEATURE CONTROL COMMANDS

Following is a list of standard command packets that have been implemented in the OE10-
Serial Rotator Unit. All additions must be included into this document through the companies
change control procedure.

NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, in the commands shown and examples given, the section
Byte* represent one(1) eight bit byte. For example in the Tilt Up Command the command sent
to the peripheral is:
**<to:from:03:TU::checksum:checksum ind>**
And the peripheral will reply with:
**<to:from:08:ACK:TUByte1Byte2Byte3:checksum:checksum ind>**

Where ACK = The ASCII non-printable ACK character = 0x
Byte1 = The number of hundreds of degrees
Byte2 = The number of tens of degrees
Byte3 = The number of units of degrees
So to reply with an angle of 276 degrees, the reply would be:
**<to:from:08:ACK:TU276:checksum:checksum ind>**

```
Where a byte corresponds to a non-printable character in the ASCII codes it will be shown in
the command and its reply as its Hexadecimal value except for the non-printable characters
“ACK”(0x06) and “NAK”(0x15) which will be shown explicitly. If the byte is a printable
character it will be shown in its printable form not as its hexadecimal value.
```


```
Check Status command:
Sent to peripheral device :
**<to:from:03:ST::checksum:checksum ind>**
Returned from peripheral device:
**<to:from:0D:ACK:STByte1Byte2Byte3...Byte9:checksum:checksum ind>**
Byte1 = Status information of the camera.
Bit0 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit1 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit2 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit3 = Pan supported
Bit4 = Tilt supported
Bit5 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit6 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit7 = N/A Reads as ‘0’

Byte2 bit 5 is used as an error flag. If not set then there are no errors. If set to 1 then there is an
error with the device. If an error is raised the specific error can be found by interrogating the
unit with the error diagnosis command.
Byte2 = Status information of the product.
Bit0 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit1 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit2 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit3 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit4 = N/A Reads as ‘0’
Bit5 = Error Flag
Bit6 = Reserved
Bit7 = Reserved

Byte3 = N/A for the OE10-

Byte4 to Byte6 = Pan position if applicable.
Where Byte4 = Hundreds of Degrees,
Where Byte5 = Tens of Degrees,
Where Byte6 = Single Degrees,
transmitted as ASCII characters in the range 0x30h to 0x39h
(e.g. 000 = 0x30h 0x30h 0x30h , 270 = 0x32h 0x37h 0x30h)

Byte7 to Byte9 = Tilt position if applicable.
Where Byte7 = Hundreds of Degrees,
Where Byte8 = Tens of Degrees,
Where Byte9 = Single Degrees,
transmitted as ASCII characters in the range 0x30h to 0x39h
(e.g. 000 = 0x30h 0x30h 0x30h , 270 = 0x32h 0x37h 0x30h)



```
```
Change ID command:
Sent to peripheral device :
**<to:from:04:SI:*:checksum:checksum ind>**
Where * = the new peripheral id. The id must be 1 byte in the range 0x02 to 0xFE. (0x00, 0x
and 0xFF are reserved addresses and cannot be used)
Returned from peripheral device:
**<to:from:04:ACK:SI:checksum:checksum ind>**
When the peripheral receives the Change ID command it will CHANGE to the NEW id and
transmit the return packet with the NEW id in the “from” section of the packet. This means that
the controller will have to swap to the new id to receive the peripherals returned packet. The
controller MUST then reply to the peripheral with a status command or a pan and tilt status
command. This allows the peripheral to tell whether the controller is receiving on the
peripherals new id. If no status command of either type, is received from the controller within
1 second the peripheral will swap back to the old id and wait for commands from the controller.
The controller will revert back to the original address if no response to the status command is
received.

Request Protocol Version Command:
Send to peripheral command:
**<to:from:03:PV::checksum:checksum ind>**
Returned from peripheral device:
**<to:from:06:ACK:PVXY:checksum:checksum ind>**
Where X and Y are the ASCII version number of this document at time of software issue
(e.g. _B or 1A where “_” is a space character).

Request Software Version command:
Send to peripheral command:
**<to:from:03:CV::checksum:checksum ind>**
Returned from peripheral device:
**<to:from:0A:ACK:CVByte1Byte2...Byte 5Byte6:checksum:checksum ind>**
Byte1 = Major Change 1st Digit Hex Value
Byte2 = Major Change 2nd Digit Hex Value
Byte3 = Minor Change 1st Digit Hex Value
Byte4 = Minor Change 2nd Digit Hex Value
Byte5 = Revision Change 1st Digit Hex Value
Byte6 = Revision Change 2nd Digit Hex Value

An example of the data bytes would be
0x30 0x31 0x30 0x34 0x32 0x38 = software version 01 04 28.

```
Bit0 = Over Temperature Error
Bit1 = Low Oil Level Error

Bit3 = Over Current Error
Bit4 = Tilt Stall Error
Bit5 = Pan Stall Error
Bit6 = Reserved
Bit7 = Reserved
Byte2 to ...Byte_n = Error information from the peripheral.

as specified above.
NAK command:

```
```
Where Command = Command that was initially sent to the device and caused the NAK reply.
```
```
Byte1 = Error code returned by the peripheral. The error code will consist of one(1) byte of data
where each bit represents a specific error.
Byte1 = Error Byte.
Bit0 = 1 Error: Device under control of another controller

## Command sent to the Device <to:from:03:FN::checksum:checksum ind >

## NAK reply: <to:from:05:NAK:FN2:checksum:checksum ind >



```
# 5. DEFAULT/BROADCAST ADDRESS:

```
There is also a default/broadcast address. All peripherals connected to the network will enact
the specified command. The broadcast address is fixed and cannot be changed. This is
characterized by the TO section being set to 0xFF with all other sections being as standard for
the required command
e.g. <FF:from:length:command:data_1 data_2 data_3.......data_n:checksum:checksum ind>
```
```
Care MUST be taken when using the broadcast format when operating on a multi-peripheral
network to avoid corrupting id settings etc in the peripherals. It is up to the programmer to
ensure that care is taken, with relevant warnings, when using the broadcast packet on a network
as the peripheral will not conduct any checks out with its usual checks.
```
